> CLI to transpile atomic [Fountain](https://www.fountain.io) screenplay files

Don't know what that means? Are you non-technical? I'll explain in layman terms â€“ it may just be exactly what you need!

## Purpose

After evaluating many other screenwriting tools, I've found the [Fountain](https://www.fountain.io) format to be exactly what I was looking for. Fountain is *a simple markup syntax that allows screenplays to be written, edited, and shared in plain, human-readable text*.

> tl;dr, *markup files* are **Versatile** + **Portable** + **Robust** + **Future-proof**. [Fountain](https://www.fountain.io) is **open-source** and **[intuitive](https://fountain.io/syntax/)** to use. It is **easily exported** to `.pdf`, `.fdx`, and more.

The only roadblock for me is that you are required by Fountain's workflow design to have your entire script to be in one single `.fountain` file. A typical 2-hour movie screenplay is about **120 pages long**. What I've noticed was:

- To compare scenes:
  - Random scrolling to arbitrary locations, back and forth
- To swap around chunks of script:
  - Dragging across hundreds-of-lines of text in order to copy-and-paste
- To temporarily stash currently-unused/incompatible scenes that may have potential, or at least to keep as reference:
  - Commenting/boneyard-ing out, or dumping aside, entire sections into another text file, hard to keep track of what is where

> This is where `spillway` comes in.

`spillway` is an extension of the Fountain workflow that incorporates programming paradigms/principles. The main concept is to use
